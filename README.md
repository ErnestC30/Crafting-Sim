**Introduction**</br>
Welcome to the Epic 7 Crafting Simulator.
I made this to learn web development with Flask/Python and HTML/CSS/JS.

To start crafting, register an account and log in.
The crafting is similar to the one in Epic 7.
Start with 4 random equipment stats that correspond to the randomly chosen equipment type.
The equipment can be enhanced a maximum of 5 times.
Each enhancement will upgrade one of the stats randomly but a random value.
Once max enhanced, the weapon can be stored into the database.

The user can view their own crafts, and delete if desired.
There is sorting functionality enabled in the tables to sort by any stat or the equipment's gear score (measurement of how well the stats rolled)
There is also a leaderboard section where the user can view other user's crafts and compare stats.

There is also a working demo at: https://e7craftingsim.herokuapp.com/
Note: Images do not seem to load properly on heroku since images do not work on the deployment server.
